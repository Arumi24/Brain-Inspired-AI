Programmed a **_Boltzmann Machine_** from scratch, a **_Boltzmann Machine_** is a **_stochastic recurrent neural network_** for **_unsupervised learning_** they can be seen as the **_stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield networks._** They were one of the first neural networks capable of learning **_internal representations_** and are able to represent and (given sufficient time) solve combinatoric problems. Theory for the implementation is available
